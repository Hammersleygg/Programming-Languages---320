# Assignment 2 - TypeScript

This program takes 2 command line arguments, one being a file name and the other being a number, and sorting them using merge sort based on the argument number. 

## Setup

This program is run from the command line. To run you must compile into java script, 

 "npx tsc Assignment2_GavinH.ts"

Then run it as a JS using the arguments 

 "node Assignment2_GavinH.js FILE_NAME.txt #" 


As long as the file is in the location your terminal is linked to it will run and output (answers will vary based on the 
number you choose to sort with): 

Sorted File Contents: 
[ 'Bascom FL', ' 32423', ' 🛩', ' Airplane (U+1F6E9)' ]
[ 'Makaweli HI', ' 96769', ' 🐈', ' Cat (U+1F408)a' ]
[ 'Lafayette LA', ' 70507', ' 🐿', ' Chipmunk (U+1F43F)' ]
[ 'Mexia TX', ' 76667', ' 🐕', ' Dog (U+1F415)' ]
[ 'White Plains NY', ' 10601', ' 🏠', ' House (U+1F3E0)' ]


## Notes:

In order to execute this program I used this website to help elaborate on the merge sort algorithm
