# Assignment 3 - Haskell

This program takes a list of items as a parameter and preforms a quickSort on the list. 

## Setup

This program is run from the command line. To run type:

ghci

:l Assignment3_GavinH.hs

-- for example:
 
quickSort[1,7,2,9,10,3,15] 

After running that example the output will be:
{1,2,3,7,9,10,15]


## Notes:

In order to execute this program I used this website to refresh on the quick sort algorithm.
