# Assignment 1 - JavaScript

The program takes the name of a comma-delimited text file (CSV) as input on the command line, sorts the file by the first field and prints the file.

## Setup

This program is run from the command line. To run type in 'node Assignment1_GavinH.js'

It runs a file named: 'SampleFile_A1.txt'

As long as the file is in the location your terminal is linked to it will run and output: 

Sorted contents: 
🏠, House (U+1F3E0)
🐈, Cat (U+1F408)
🐕, Dog (U+1F415)
🐿, Chipmunk (U+1F43F)
🛩, Airplane (U+1F6E9)


## Notes:

In order to execute this program I used this website to help elaborate on the bubble sort algorithm
